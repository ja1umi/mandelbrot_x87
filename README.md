# Mandelbrot set drawing program in x86+x87 assembly language

## Prerequisites

* [Bochs](https://bochs.sourceforge.io/)
* x86 Assember


x86 assembler is not required to run the provided image files. However, you will need it if you want to try your own modification(s).  I've used [Netwide Assembler](https://www.nasm.us/).
